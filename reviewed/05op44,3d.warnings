============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 132, '1/4', 'vi') ms3.Parse.mendelssohn_quartets.05op44,3d
	The label 'vi' in m. 131, onset 1/4 (MC 132, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Eb.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('6', '1', '3') [('C', 'Eb', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.8 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
