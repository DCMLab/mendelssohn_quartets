Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 3, '0', 'V2(9)/V') ms3.Parse.mendelssohn_quartets.04op44,2a
	The label 'V2(9)/V' in m. 3, onset 0 (MC 3, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of e.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('1', '2', '#4', '#6') [('E', 'F#', 'A#', 'C#')] plus the added ('#3',) [('G#',)].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.625 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
